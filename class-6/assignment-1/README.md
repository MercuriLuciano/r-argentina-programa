# Family-members-age-form

A proyect for get the family size, create age inputs for each member, calculate/display oldest, youngest, and average age on button click.

## Assignment

Ask how many people are in the family group.
Create as many inputs+labels as there are people to complete the age of each member.
When clicking on "calculate", show in a pre-existing element the oldest age, the youngest age, and the average age of the family group.

Bonus point: Create a "clear" button that restarts the process, deleting the previously created inputs (research how to do it on MDN).
