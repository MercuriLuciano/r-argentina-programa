# total-class-time-calculator
 A proyect that calculates the total time of "r/argentina programa" videos by entering their times in hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Assignment

For each existing "r/argentina programa" class, we are going to request:
Hours, minutes and seconds of each video. For example, if a video lasts 2 hours, 38 minutes and 20 seconds, we are going to fill 3 text fields with each piece of data.
By pressing the "Calculate total time" button, the total time of the videos should be displayed in a previously created 'strong' tag.

## Notes

I added an input where the user enters the number of classes and when they press submit, inputs for corresponding hours, minutes, and seconds per class are generated.
