# Family-members-salary-form

Create an interface to calculate the average, annual, and monthly salaries of a family's working members, ignoring empty fields.

## Assignment

Create an interface that allows adding or removing (add and remove buttons) inputs + labels to complete the annual salary of each working family member. Upon clicking "calculate", display the highest annual salary, lowest annual salary, average annual salary, and average monthly salary in a pre-existing element.

Bonus point: if there are empty inputs, ignore them in the calculation (do not count them as 0).
